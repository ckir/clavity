# AGY-CAPSTONE ledger

One row per capstone. Appended before a plan may be declared complete.

**This is a RECORD, not a proof.** Nothing prevents someone appending a GREEN line without running
anything; a self-asserted ledger is the same shape as the re-stamping defect the verify gate removed.
Two things keep it honest, neither a guarantee: the `evidence` column must cite something independently
checkable, and the ledger is reviewed like any other artifact rather than trusted like a gate output.

**`none` is not a permitted evidence value.** A capstone that goes green on its first round still
produces a transcript — the rounds it ran, the lenses it seated, what it tried. Cite that. If there is
nothing to cite, the entry does not go in.

**Absences are meaningful.** SP-0, SP-A, SP-C and SP-D do not appear below. They never had a
reconstructible capstone; their evidence is a verification transcript under
`docs/superpowers/verification/`, which is a different and weaker claim, deliberately not laundered into
this table.
